			<h3>Fast Learning Technologies</h3>
			<p>
				My experience and my passion to programming allows me, somehow, to learn quite fast some technologies that we need for our projects. More precisely, i'm talking about almost all web technologies, specially JavaScript that is by far one of my favorite (as you can you in the list bellow).
			</p>
			<h3>Learn & Teach</h3>
			<p>
				I often learn from online sources and free documentation, the fact that we allowed me to get these information freely, someone spend time to produce and provide them so i can also spend time teaching the others all i know to others who desire to learn
			</p>
			<h3>Compagny Economic Awareness</h3>
			<p>
				I like the idea of Teaching and Learning its a great idea within a compagny, it helps enhance project and compagny reputation.
				Beside technological application, managing a team to respect the client desire precisely and in time is also a point that is almost as important.
