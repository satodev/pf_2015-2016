One more portfolio that will be made through AngularJS to make a beautiful and dynamic site presenting all my project that i'm proud of.

## Keywords

User interface **simplicity** : clear informations, easy to use

## Functionnalities/Features

- AngularJS 1.4-0

## Improvements

It's the beginning of the project, we will fill every functionality and project one after an other
- Routes -> Presentationn, Portfolio, Contact
- Content : Put all the information before doing anything with the style
- Animation : Clean little animation that enhance the content

## Page Organisation

For a Portfolio the organisation page is quite simple :
	- Home -> presenting a bit of me and all the features on that website
	- Portfolio -> presenting all my recent projects
	- Contact -> All the way to contact me beside a contact form

## Home / Presentation

Some of the things i know and may be usefull for compagnies ( i'll write down all the points that seemd important for me and then clear them up, or rearrange them):
- Fast Learning Technologies/Languages (1 week for the simpliest and 2 month for the hardest within a high pace workflow)
- Obvious passion to learn and teach
- Compagny aware work (respecting delais, work within a team, manage client command)
- Good programming (ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) programming)

## Portfolio

I have to deal with a big mission here, a lot of my old project were destroyed, but anyway i will refound a project a least for one technologies that i do know, for exemple :
- Programming Technologies
	- JS (jQuery, Vanilla, AngularJS, JSON, Node.js)
	- PHP (Sympfony, phalcon)
	- HTML/CSS (Boostrap, media queries)
	- Canvas ( already done with DateTime)

- System Use (in this order)
	- Windows
	- Linux
	- Mac 

Beside that mission i can already show some recent project like :
- DateTime

## Contact

Different way to contact me like : 
	- Social Media : LinkedIn, Google+, StackOverflow, Github
	- Contact Form
	- Maybe Google Map as in my previous PF

## PUT ON SERVER

There is a couple of things that you must do if you want to put that project on a server, four things actually : 
	- Change de base in the index.php in the header section from "/pf_2015-2016/" to "/"
	- correct all the link that has "/pf_2015-2016/" in it
	- Change ngRoute values in js/script.js
	- Change .htaccess file corresponding to your server configuration
